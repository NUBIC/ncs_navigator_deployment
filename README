Overview
========

This repository contains (or will contain) a Chef repository for provisioning
the NCS Navigator application suite and a Vagrant configuration for testing
provisioning scripts, applications, and setting up development infrastructure.

Most of the information needed to set up an NCS Navigator application suite is
public; however, as is the case with all deployments, some information must be
kept private (i.e. keys).


Required materials
==================

- A Vagrant box.
  The box MUST use NAT on eth0 and host-only networking on eth1.  Host-only
  addresses used are 192.168.56.[220,222]/24.  For other configurations,
  alter the Vagrantfile.

- The private key for that box.
  The key SHOULD be in the repository directory and SHOULD be named
  ncs-vagrant.  For other configurations, alter the Vagrantfile.

- A Chef server.
  The Chef server SHOULD have an environment called development.  For other
  configurations, alter the Vagrantfile.

- The validation key for your Chef server.
  The key SHOULD be in the repository directory.  The Vagrantfile assumes a
  name of nubic-validator.pem; for other configurations, alter the
  Vagrantfile.
