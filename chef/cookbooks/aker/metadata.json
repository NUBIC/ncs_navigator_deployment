  "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the `aker_central` LWRP for setting up pieces of an Aker central\nconfiguration file.\n\nBecause the Aker central configuration file can be used by multiple libraries\n(e.g. Aker and its predecessor Bcsec), this cookbook does install any\nparticular library.\n\nUsage example:\n\n    aker_central \"cas\" do\n      base_url \"https://cas.example.edu/cas\"\n      proxy_callback_url \"https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/receive_pgt\"\n      proxy_retrieval_url \"https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/retrieve_pgt\"\n    end\n\nThe `cas` block of the central configuration file would then be\n\n    base_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas\n    proxy_callback_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/receive_pgt\n    proxy_retrieval_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/retrieve_pgt\n\nand, if this were the only aker_central resource defined, the entire\nconfiguration file would be\n\n    cas:\n      base_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas\n      proxy_callback_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/receive_pgt\n      proxy_retrieval_url: https://cas.example.edu/cas-proxy-callback/retrieve_pgt\n\nIf the `cas` block already existed in the configuration file, it would be\nreplaced.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* `application_users`\n\n= ATTRIBUTES:\n\n* `aker[:central][:path]`: Path to the generated configuration file.  Defaults\n  to `/etc/nubic/bcsec-prod.yml`.\n* `aker[:central][:group]`: The group for the central configuration file.\n  Defaults to the node's value of `application_users[:group]`, or \"app\" if that\n  isn't defined.\n\n= USAGE:\n\nInclude the recipe in your run list and go.\n\nThe bcdatabase configuration for Pers needs to be supplied manually.\n",
