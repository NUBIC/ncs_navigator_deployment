# CAS-via-Tomcat is only checked every other cycle; the same should apply here.
# There's no point in checking the proxy more often than the app server.

# To avoid conflicts with other Web monitoring checks, these connection tests
# should remain informational.  Active monitoring is done in the apache check
# block.
